## Storydriven Developer Test

* Set up a REST API that provides text and image urls for this single page - https://www.maracielo.com/residences/.
* Set up up a site/web app that calls the Rest API and retrieves the page data used reconstruct the look and feel of the same page: https://www.maracielo.com/residences/.
* Image assets are supplied in repository
* Fonts can be included through google fonts '//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,300i,400,400i,700'. ('Lato', sans-serif)
* Build the page prioritizing component functionality and reuse, structure and styling (colors and layout) of the page, the header nav and footer sections can be screenshots.
* Ignore form functionality.
* Ignore AgentShield script functionality.
* Integrate with as many modern development features as possible (e.g. Live reloading, linting, script bundling + minification, image compression, font loading, SASS, ES6 javascript).
* This site uses Bootstrap 4 but you may use any library if need be.
* Both the REST API and site/web app should be able to run as localhost servers and supply minimal documentation to start both.
* Complete as much as possible in 2 hours.
* Commit all code as well as Readme file instructions for how to serve both the REST API and site/web app to a github/bitbucket repository.
* Feel free to ask any questions if stuck or anything is missing - lenny@storydriven.com.
